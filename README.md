# vitex
An unholy conglomeration of vim, evince, and friends for writing LaTeX

## Goal

Do you prefer to use vim to edit your LaTeX files, but wish there was better integration between the editor and your pdf viewer? Well this is the project for you! The goal of vitex is to bring together high quality tools in a convenient package to make editing LaTeX as painless(tm) as possible.

## Status

Currently working on arch linux with the Gnome desktop environment.

## Features!

  - Custom `init.vim` for editing LaTeX (of course feel free to personalize)
  - Embedded PDF view using Evince with auto reload
  - That's pretty much it!
